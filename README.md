# World's Hardest Game 
This project uses C in order to recreate drawing and gme logic for the World's Hardest Game.

## Usage
In order to run this code, you must use a DE1-SOC with Arm V7, or can test it on https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc&d_audio=48000

If using CPULator, copy the code onto the editor, change the language to C, and Compile and Load the program. The program should be visible on the VGA Display on the sidebar.

Use any of the Switches to continue through text screens. Use the pushbuttons to move the player. (0 - Down, 1 - Right, 2 - Left, 3 - Up).

## Objective
The objective of the game is to collect ALL the coins (yellow), while avoiding the moving obstacles (blue), and get the player (red) to the other side of the screen to the platform (green).
